Downloader

You are making a file downloader.
To make the downloads faster, you decide to use concurrency. 
Each file download will run as a separate Goroutine.

To simulate a file download, the download() function needs to take the size of the file as an argument 
and count the sum of all integers from 0 to that number (inclusive).

The given program takes three file sizes as inputs and calls the download() function 
as Goroutines for each file.
Complete the program by declaring the download() function 
and sending the result of their operation to main() using channels. 
The results should be added together in main() and output.
